Simple PHP Quiz Tutorial

This is the source code for the PHP Quiz tutorial found at https://www.lockedownseo.com/build-a-quiz-in-php-tutorial .

In this example, the user answers five multiple choice questions that determine What Metal Band they most resemble. Each possible outcome starts with a score of zero, and corresponding answers add to the score. Whichever outcome has the highest score at the end is shown.

Much thanks to Chris Coyier and CSS-Tricks for giving me the initial blueprint: http://css-tricks.com/building-a-simple-quiz/

Things You Can Do With This:
---------------------------------------------

You can embed the Metal Quiz in your own site (just copy + paste in source or a plain text widget. Don't forget to change the brackets):

<code>[iframe src="https://metalquiz.sacramentowebdesigns.com/" height="450" width="600"][/iframe]</code>

You can modify it for your own needs. This has an MIT license.

You can tear it apart and rebuild it again. Learning is something that never stops.
